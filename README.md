![ZXing.Net.Mobile Logo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/micjahn/ZXing.Net/master/Icons/logo.jpg)

## Project Description
A library which supports decoding and generating of barcodes (like QR Code, PDF 417, EAN, UPC, Aztec, Data Matrix, Codabar) within images.

The project is a port of the java based barcode reader and generator library ZXing.  
https://github.com/zxing/zxing  
It has been ported by hand with a lot of optimizations and improvements.

The following barcodes are supported by the decoder:
UPC-A, UPC-E, EAN-8, EAN-13, Code 39, Code 93, Code 128, ITF, Codabar, MSI, RSS-14 (all variants), QR Code, Data Matrix, Aztec and PDF-417.
The encoder supports the following formats:
UPC-A, EAN-8, EAN-13, Code 39, Code 128, ITF, Codabar, Plessey, MSI, QR Code, PDF-417, Aztec, Data Matrix

#### Assemblies are available for the following platforms:

* .Net 2.0, 3.5, 4.0, 4.5, 4.6 and 4.7
* Silverlight 4 and 5
* Windows Phone 7.0, 7.1 and 8.0
* Windows CE
* Windows RT Class Library and Runtime Components (winmd)
* .NET Standard / .NET Core / UWP
* Portable Class Library
* Unity3D (.Net 2.0 built without System.Drawing reference)
* Xamarin.Android (formerly Mono for Android)
* bindings to CoreCompat.System.Drawing, ImageSharp, SkiaSharp, OpenCVSharp, Magick, Kinect V1 and V2
* support COM interop, can be used with VBA

The library is available in the release section [release section](https://github.com/micjahn/ZXing.Net/releases) and as [NuGet package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/ZXing.Net/), too.

#### Additional platform support without pre-built binaries
The library can be built for Xamarin.iOS (formerly MonoTouch). The project file and solution are available in the source code repository.

A special version for the [.Net Micro Framework](http://www.microsoft.com/netmf/) can be found in a separate branch in the source code repository.

## Thanks
Many thanks to the team of the [zxing project](https://github.com/zxing/zxing) for their great work. ZXing.Net would not be possible without your work!
## Usage examples
The source code repository includes small examples for Windows Forms, Silverlight, Windows Phone and other project types.

#### small example decoding a barcode inside a bitmap (.Net 2.0/3.5/4.x)
```csharp
// create a barcode reader instance
IBarcodeReader reader = new BarcodeReader();
// load a bitmap
var barcodeBitmap = (Bitmap)Image.LoadFrom("C:\\sample-barcode-image.png");
// detect and decode the barcode inside the bitmap
var result = reader.Decode(barcodeBitmap);
// do something with the result
if (result != null)
{
   txtDecoderType.Text = result.BarcodeFormat.ToString();
   txtDecoderContent.Text = result.Text;
}
```
